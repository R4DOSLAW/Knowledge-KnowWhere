Unity animations is a big topic, so to cope with it Iâ€™ve split it into seven stages from basic to advanced.
## **Stage 1: [[ðŸŽ“ Animation Fundamentals in Unity]]**

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Understand Unity's core animation tools and systems.

### **Topics:**

- Difference between skeletal (rigged) and procedural animation
    
- [[Animator]], [[Animator Controller]], and [[Animation Clip]]
    
- [[Timeline]] and [[Cinemachine]] for cutscenes
    
- Importing characters from [[Mixamo]] and the [[Asset Store]]
    
- Using Animator Controller and [[Blend Trees]]
    

### **Practical Project:**

Create a basic scene with a humanoid NPC (from Mixamo) that can **walk, run, and idle** using animations.

---

## **Stage 2: Rigging & Skinning Custom Meshes**

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Learn how to prepare your own models for animation

### **Topics:**

- What is [[Rigging]], [[Bones]], and [[Skinning]]
    
- Creating a simple rig in Blender and exporting it to Unity
    
- Tools for animation retargeting in Unity
    

### **Practical Project:**

Model a simple creature or animal in Blender, add bones, and animate **head and leg movement** in Unity.

---

## **Stage 3: Driving Animations with Code**

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Connect animation logic with game logic

### **Topics:**

- Using `Animator.SetTrigger`, `SetBool`, `SetFloat`
    
- Animator parameters and transitions
    
- [[Root Motion]] vs [[Script-Driven Motion]]
    
- [[Animation Events]] in clips
    

### **Practical Project:**

Control NPC animations through code. For example, when the player approaches, the NPC starts waving.

---

## **Stage 4: Advanced Weapon & Item Animation**

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Animate interactive objects like weapons

### **Topics:**

- Animating weapon actions: reload, aim, shoot
    
- [[Reparenting]] and [[IK (Inverse Kinematics)]] for hands
    
- Using [[Timeline]] for weapon unfolding/explosion
    
- [[Procedural Animation]]: recoil, sway, bobbing
    

### **Practical Project:**

Add a weapon (e.g., sword or rifle) that the player can **pick up and use**, with full animation transitions.

---

## **Stage 5: Vehicles & Mechanical Animation**

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Animate complex, mechanical and interactive objects

### **Topics:**

- [[Animating vehicles]] wheels, suspension, and doors
    
- Blending physical and animated movement
    
- IK legs positioning for mounting vehicles
    

### **Practical Project:**

Create a basic vehicle (e.g., jeep) the player can **drive**, including **enter/exit animations**.

---

## **Stage 6: Animals & Non-Humanoid Entities**

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Animate non-humanoid and creature movement naturally

### **Topics:**

- [[Quadruped rigging (4-legged animals)]]
    
- [[Procedural Animation]]: snakes, fish, tentacles
    
- [[Flying creatures]] â€“ wings, gliding, hovering
    

### **Practical Project:**

Add one **animal** and one **flying creature** to your scene (e.g., wolf and bat) and create simple **AI-driven animations**.

---

## **Stage 7: Final Polish & Optimization**

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Bring everything together and refine the project

### **Topics:**

- Synchronizing multiple Animator Controllers
    
- [[Animation optimization]]: baking, LODs, culling
    
- [[Final FX]]: particles, sound, light synced to animation
    
- Creating a cinematic intro using Timeline + Cinemachine
    

### **Practical Project:**

Produce a **short cinematic trailer** of your animated scene using **camera movements, sound, character animations**, and transitions.
