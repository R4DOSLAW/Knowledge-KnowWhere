### 🧠 What is Skeletal Animation?

Skeletal Animation (also known as **rigged animation**) is a technique used in **3D character animation** where the model is divided into two key parts:

- **Mesh (Skin):** The visual surface of the character.
- **Skeleton (Rig or Armature):** A hierarchy of bones that controls the mesh.

When the bones move, the mesh deforms accordingly, allowing for realistic animation like walking, jumping, waving, etc.

### 🦴 Key Components

| Component                                                                   | Description                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bone/Joint**<br>![[Pasted image 20250531153934.png]]                      | A pivot point that controls parts of the mesh.                            |
| **Rig**<br>![[Pasted image 20250531152932.png]]                             | A skeleton composed of multiple bones.                                    |
| **Skinning**<br>![[Pasted image 20250531154624.png]]*                       | Binding the mesh to the bones, defining how it deforms with movement.     |
| **Weight Painting**<br>![[Pasted image 20250531151110.png]]                 | Specifies how much influence each bone has over the vertices of the mesh. |
| **Animator / Animation Controller**<br>![[Pasted image 20250531154738.png]] | Unity component that manages transitions and playback of animations.      |

### 🧩 How It Works (Simplified Steps)

1. **3D Artist creates a mesh** in tools like Blender or Maya.
3. **Bones (rig) are added** inside the mesh forming a skeleton.
4. **Mesh is skinned** (bound) to the skeleton.
5. **Animations are created** by rotating and moving bones over time.
6. **Exported as FBX** or similar format and imported into Unity.
7. **Animator Controller in Unity** manages state transitions for different animations (idle, walk, jump, etc.)

### 🔧 Unity Integration

```plaintext
Assets/
├── Models/
│   └── Character.fbx (includes mesh, bones, and animations)
├── Animations/
│   ├── Idle.anim
│   ├── Walk.anim
│   └── Run.anim
├── Animator/
│   └── CharacterController.controller
```

> 🔗 The FBX file contains the rigged mesh and animations baked into it.

**Workflow in Unity:**
- Import the FBX.
- Drag into the scene.
- Assign an Animator Controller.
- Use the `Animator` component to control animations via scripts or animation events.

### 💡 Benefits of Skeletal Animation

- **Reusable:** One rig can be used for multiple animations.
- **Lightweight:** Animations only modify bones, not the entire mesh.
- **Blendable:** Supports blending (e.g., walk + shoot).

### 📌 Example Use Cases

- Player Characters
- NPCs (Non-Player Characters)
- Animals
- Mech Robots with joints

### 🧠 Tips for Learning

- Start with **humanoid rigs**; Unity has a built-in Humanoid system.
- Use **Mixamo** to quickly get characters and animations.
- Try **blending animations** in Unity using Animator Layers and Blend Trees.
- Practice exporting from Blender or Maya to Unity.
