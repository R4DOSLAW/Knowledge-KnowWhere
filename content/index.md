# Welcome to Knowledge-KnowWhere!

[![[Pasted image 20240325085335.png|100%]]](<Roadmap>)<a> </a>

Hey there! I'm RadosÅ‚aw Jachimowicz, and you've stumbled upon my knowledge library. Here, I strive to regularly jot down everything I know and, most importantly, whatever new things I learn. I dabble in both VR game development and business programming, which is why you'll find two distinct sections on this site. Programming for business differs from game development, after all. You can learn more about this in my post: [[Game vs Business Programming - Key Differences]].

Of course, I'm not infallible, so if you spot any errors or inaccuracies, don't hesitate to let me know. You can find contact information and links to me at the bottom of the page.
